**ABSTRACT**
This study proposes a robust security protocol for online banking
transactions, leveraging a two-factor authentication system comprising a onetime password (OTP) and a password-protected non-shareable certificate. Upon
logging into the internet banking platform, a unique certificate is dynamically
generated, enhancing security by preventing certificate sharing. The certificate
is further fortified with a user-defined password, adding an additional layer of
protection.
During transaction initiation, both the OTP and certificate are transmitted
securely to the bank's server. Successful validation of both elements ensures the
transaction proceeds, while any discrepancy results in an automatic transaction
failure, safeguarding against unauthorized access attempts. This dual
authentication process provides an effective defense against fraudulent
activities, bolstering the integrity of online banking services.
By implementing this security measure, financial institutions can significantly
reduce the risk of unauthorized access and subsequent fraudulent transactions.
This system represents a vital step towards fortifying the security infrastructure
of internet banking, ensuring a safer and more reliable experience for users
